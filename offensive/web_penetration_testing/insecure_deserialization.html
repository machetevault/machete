<summary>GENERAL INFORMATION</summary>
- it is the process of converting complex data structures (objects, fields) into a "flatter" format that can be sent and received 
as a sequential stream of bytes.
- most common languages to learn, PHP / Ruby / Java for deserialization
- used for,
	- write complex data to inter-process memory, a file or a database
	- send complex data, sample, over a network, API call and more.

- exist native support for serialization depending the language. common is binary format
- one way to prevent a field to be serialized is to declare it as "transient"
- serialization on Ruby is called: marshalling / and in python it is called: pickilng

so what's <b>INSECURE DESERIALIZATION</b> ?

it is when user controlabe data is deserialized by a website. this enables a bad actor to manipulate serialized objects in order 
to pass harmful data into the app. 

<u>why this attack is effective ?</u> 
- because it can be detected after the object was deserialized which is too late as the data could start/trigger an attack, etc.
- exist a weird assuptiom that deserialized objects are trustworthy. 
- dependencies, massive pool of classes and methods that is difficult to manage securely.

<b>NOTE:</b> If checking the source code you see the following methods, serialize() / unserialize(), check further.

</details>
<details>
<summary>IDENTIFICATION</summary>

- first thing, check and double check all data being passed into the website to try to find possible serialized data.
- to know or identify serialized data it is needed to know the format of the language. for example, python serialization, 
php serialization, etc. 

<b>PHP</b>

<u>format:</u> O:4:"User":2:{s:4:"name":s:6:"carlos"; s:10:"isLoggedIn":b:1;}

<b>check:</b> https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization/exploiting to see how it can be interpreted.	

<b>JAVA</b>

- it use binary serialization. difficult to read but still identify serialized data.

<u>Key points:</u>
	- serialized objects always begin with same bytes, <b>ac ed</b> in <u>hexadecimal</u> and <b>rO0</b> in <u>base64.</u>
	- any class that implements "java.io.Serializable" is vulnerable. with help of "readObject()" method used to deserialize
	data from "InputStream".
</details>
<details>
<summary>MODIFYING SERIALIZED OBJECTS</summary>
- it can be pretty common to find php serialization codes. sometimes they are also encoded in different formats, so manual inspection
is needed.
- depending the vulnerability, a quick method to make changes is to change method type. Between, GET/POST.
- burpsuite inspector is pretty common to help on this cases. 
- it is important to understand what the serialized code is doing and what actions can be accomplish. 

<u>SAMPLE:</u> O:4:"User":2:{s:4:"name":s:6:"carlos"; s:10:"isLoggedIn":b:1;}
	
</details>
<details>
<summary>MODIFYING SERIALIZED DATA TYPES</summary>
PHP-based logic is particularly vulnerable to this kind of manipulation due to the behavior of its loose comparison operator (==) 
when comparing different data types. 

- each time the comparison is between integer > string, the integer will be prevalent. 
SAMPLE: 3 == "hola" it will be interpreted as 3 == 3 = TRUE
SAMPLE: 0 == "password" will be TRUE. "zero" is a different case as boolean option.

validations against zero can enable different ways of authentication bypass. sample #3

this is possible because deserialization preserves the data type. if not it will process different and probably provide a 
different condition.
