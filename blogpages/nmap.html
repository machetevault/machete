::: SCANS<br><br>      

-sS: Initiates a TCP SYN scan, often referred to as "half-open" scanning, as it doesn't complete the TCP handshake. <br>
-sC: Runs the default set of scripts. These scripts are part of Nmap's Scripting Engine (NSE) and are used for gathering more information about the target.<br>
-sV: Version detection; it tries to determine the software version of the running services on open ports.<br>
<br>
<br>      
--min-rate=1000: Forces Nmap to send packets no slower than 1000 packets per second.<br>
